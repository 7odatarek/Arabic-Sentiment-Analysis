# Sentiment Analysis in Arabic using Neural Networks

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis in Arabic text, leveraging advanced neural network architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers. Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, which is a crucial task in natural language processing.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis in Arabic language text
- Utilization of LSTM and Transformer neural network architectures
- Preprocessing steps for Arabic text, including normalization, tokenization, and stemming
- Evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance
